<h3>University Software Development Project</h3>
<p>This project is about warning the Android mobile users about possible physical collisions using 2 sensors of the 
Android phone(proximity sensor and accelerometer sensor).</p>
<p>Android app was created with Android Studio. Intellij IDEA was used for the
Java application to connect to the database "projectdb.mwd" which holds all the records for the collisions.</p>
<p>The Android app and the Java app (MQTT clients) are connected with the Mosquitto Broker through a Publish-Subscribe pattern.</p>
